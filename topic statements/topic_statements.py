'''
Script for creating the thematic statements based on topic modeling.
Input:
- mastermatrix file (results topic modeling)
- topic ranking file (results topic modeling)
- file with topic labels (manually generated)

Output:
- mastermatrix with additional percentage distribution of topics based on a
threshold value to be defined in the Parameters
- CSV file with prepared statements as a starting point for feeding into wikibase

Notes:
-The labelfile must be newly created for each new topic model. For this purpose,
the topics generated in the topic model are interpreted and labels
from the topic vocabulary are assigned to them.

- In order to calculate in what percentage of the works a topic occurs,
a threshold value must be defined. This threshold must be determined anew for a new topic model,
especially for a new number of topics. It should be selected in such a way
that particularly frequent and very rare topics are sorted out.
(We have defined that Topics that occur in more than 80%
and less than 10% of the works are disregarded for the statements -> see get_percentage()).
